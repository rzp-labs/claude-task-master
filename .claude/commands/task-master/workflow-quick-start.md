Quick start a new project from just an idea, handling PRD creation and initialization in one flow.

Streamlined project initialization:

1. **Capture the Idea**

   ```
   What would you like to build? Just describe it naturally:

   Examples:
   - "A CLI tool for managing docker containers"
   - "A web app for tracking personal expenses"
   - "A Python library for data validation"
   - "An API for real-time chat"
   ```

2. **Rapid Clarification**
   Ask only essential questions:

   ```
   Got it! A [PROJECT_TYPE] for [PURPOSE].

   Quick questions:
   1. Preferred language? [Auto-detect from description or ask]
   2. Target users? [Developers/End users/Both]
   3. MVP timeline? [1 week/1 month/3 months]
   ```

3. **Instant Recommendations**
   Based on the idea, immediately suggest:

   ```
   For your [PROJECT_TYPE], I recommend:

   üì¶ Stack:
   - Language: [LANGUAGE]
   - Framework: [FRAMEWORK]
   - Database: [IF_NEEDED]

   ‚ú® Key Features for MVP:
   1. [FEATURE_1]
   2. [FEATURE_2]
   3. [FEATURE_3]

   Sound good? [Y/n/modify]
   ```

4. **Generate Minimal PRD**
   Create a focused PRD:

   ```markdown
   # [Project Name] - Quick Start PRD

   ## What We're Building

   [One paragraph description]

   ## MVP Features

   - [ ] Feature 1
   - [ ] Feature 2
   - [ ] Feature 3

   ## Tech Stack

   - Language: [LANGUAGE]
   - Main Framework: [FRAMEWORK]
   - Testing: [TEST_FRAMEWORK]

   ## Success =

   [One line success metric]
   ```

5. **Immediate Initialization**
   Without waiting, proceed to:

   - Create project structure
   - Set up development environment
   - Generate initial tasks
   - Create first code files

6. **Smart Task Generation**
   Generate fewer, focused tasks for quick start:

   ```
   Generated 8 MVP tasks:
   1. ‚úÖ Project setup (done!)
   2. ‚è∏Ô∏è Core data model
   3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Basic [MAIN_FEATURE]
   4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Simple CLI/API interface
   5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Error handling
   6. ‚è∏Ô∏è Basic tests
   7. ‚è∏Ô∏è Documentation
   8. ‚è∏Ô∏è Package/Deploy
   ```

7. **Instant Development Start**

   ```
   ‚úÖ Project initialized!
   ‚úÖ Environment ready!
   ‚úÖ Tasks created!

   Let's start coding! First task:

   Task #2: Create core data model
   - Define the main [ENTITY] structure
   - Add validation
   - Create tests

   Ready? [Start coding!]
   ```

8. **Progressive Enhancement**
   As you work, suggest:

   ```
   Working great! As you progress, consider:
   - Add authentication? (Task #9)
   - Add caching? (Task #10)
   - Add monitoring? (Task #11)

   Or keep it simple for MVP!
   ```

9. **Quick Start Templates**
   Offer common patterns:

   ```
   Want to start from a template?

   1. REST API Starter
   2. CLI Tool Starter
   3. Web App Starter
   4. Library Starter
   5. From scratch (current)
   ```

10. **One Command Wonder**
    The entire flow from idea to coding:

    ```
    You: /workflows:quick-start "expense tracker web app"

    Claude: [Creates PRD, initializes project, starts first task]

    5 minutes later: You're writing actual code!
    ```

This workflow is perfect for:

- Hackathons
- Proof of concepts
- Learning projects
- When inspiration strikes
- "I just want to start coding"

The key: Minimize setup time, maximize coding time!
