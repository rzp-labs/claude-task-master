/code-reasoning:code-review (MCP) There are a number of tests failing now. I parallelized 3 agents to attack the tests and I would like you to complete a code review for each, and determine what, if anything, we should bring over from their work. The prompt also required that they create an XML file in the project root describing what they changed to make it easier for you to assess against .git. First, try to use Repomix to pack the worktrees. Otherwise, you may need to pack each individually. use git -C to review across as you cannot CD out of the project directory.

The worktrees are located here /Users/stephen/.local/share/uzi/worktrees/
