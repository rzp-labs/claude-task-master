        "details": "## Test Review Objectives\n\n1. **Identify Over-Engineered Test Cases**\n   - Look for tests that verify complex configuration scenarios that no longer exist\n   - Find tests checking for edge cases in removed features\n   - Locate tests for error patterns that have been simplified\n\n2. **Compare with Expand Task Implementation**\n   - Review how expand-task.test.js handles similar functionality\n   - Ensure enhancement tests follow similar patterns for:\n     - Mock setup and AI provider interactions\n     - Success/failure scenarios\n     - Progress reporting and user feedback\n\n3. **Test Categories to Review**\n   - Configuration validation tests (ensure they match new limited options)\n   - Error handling tests (avoid creating new error patterns)\n   - Integration tests (should be minimal and focused)\n   - Mode behavior tests (if modes have been simplified)\n   - Timeout tests (verify against new 15s minimum)\n\n4. **Documentation Requirements**\n   - Create a list of tests to be removed\n   - Create a list of tests needing modification\n   - Note any missing tests for core functionality\n   - Ensure test names and descriptions match actual behavior\n\n5. **Key Files to Review**\n   - tests/unit/scripts/modules/task-manager/enhance-task-details*.test.js\n   - tests/integration/task-enhancement-workflow.test.js\n   - Compare with: tests/unit/scripts/modules/task-manager/expand-task.test.js\n\n6. **Simplification Guidelines**\n   - Remove tests for features that no longer exist\n   - Consolidate redundant test scenarios\n   - Ensure error handling follows existing patterns (no new error types)\n   - Verify mocks are minimal and match actual usage",
        "testStrategy": "1. Run all enhancement-related tests and categorize failures by type\n2. Cross-reference test assertions with actual implementation in enhance-task-details.js\n3. Compare test complexity with expand-task.test.js as a baseline\n4. Create a markdown document listing:\n   - Tests to remove (with rationale)\n   - Tests to modify (with specific changes needed)\n   - Tests that are properly aligned (can stay as-is)\n5. Verify that remaining tests cover:\n   - Basic enhancement trigger on status change\n   - Timeout handling (15s minimum)\n   - Success and failure paths\n   - Integration with AI providers\n6. Ensure no tests are creating new patterns for error handling or configuration that don't exist in other parts of the codebase",
