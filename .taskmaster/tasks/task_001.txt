# Task ID: 1
# Title: Research Git Worktree Basic Requirements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Research Git worktree commands and understand basic usage patterns. Focus on practical implementation needs for MVP.
# Details:
Focus on understanding the basics needed for implementation. No performance testing or complex scenarios - just what we need to build the MVP.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing with a sample repository

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test basic Git worktree commands [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Manually test git worktree add, remove, list, and prune to understand their behavior
### Details:
Create a test repository and run through basic worktree operations:
- git worktree add ./test-worktree
- git worktree list
- git worktree remove ./test-worktree
- Document command outputs and any errors encountered

## 2. Verify Git version requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Check that Git 2.5+ is available and test worktree features
### Details:
Run git --version and verify it's 2.5 or higher. Test that worktree commands are available. Document the exact version being used for development.

## 3. Document worktree limitations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Note key limitations like one branch per worktree and submodule handling
### Details:
Create a simple notes file documenting:
- One branch per worktree restriction
- How worktrees handle submodules
- Any platform-specific issues encountered
- Keep it practical, not theoretical
