Critical Modifications Recommended Responses

1. Accelerate Resource Management


    - Move worktree pooling from Phase 4 to Phase 2
      **REQUEST** tell me more about worktree pooling.

    - Implement automated cleanup service in Phase 1
      **FEEDBACK** - I don't think automation should be in MVP. I think it adds too much complexity and risk (purging a worktree because someone went on vacation)

    - Add explicit resource limits (e.g., max 20 worktrees)
      **FEEDBACK** - Not MVP. Since this will be used primarily with AI code agents, I think we should start at 1 and then enumerate to see how n+1 potentially adds complexity we weren't handling previously.

2. Enhance Reliability


    - Add fallback mode for Git <2.5 environments
      **CLOSED** - already addressed and removed.

    - Include worktree health monitoring in Phase 2
      **REQUEST** - tell me more about what health are we monitoriting, what we would do if we determined `unhealhty` and what the consequences of no monitoring

    - Implement state recovery tools in Phase 1
      **REQUEST** - tell me more about state recovery and what we are recovering from

3. Improve Migration Path


    - Create migration tool for existing agent work
      **QUESTION** - what are we migrating from? In my experience, especially with AI agents, git worktrees should be very short lived, which means delay in migration could be minutes to hours. Feels like added complexiity that would take longer to develop than it would to 'migrate' the existing agent work

    - Add "dry-run" mode for destructive operations
      **REQUEST** - tell me more about what problem this recommendation solves for and which types of destructive actions we are solving for. This feels a bit like the it has the same problem as 'enabled' in that the tool is only as good as it is actually used.

    - Include backwards compatibility strategy
      **QUESTION** - which backwards state concerns you?

4. Add Missing Components


    - Performance benchmarking suite
      **QUESTION** - what is the 'job to be done' for this? What are we benchmarking and how will that data be used to inform decisions downstream?

    - Worktree backup before deletion
      **QUESTION** - is this automated or must it be triggered? If the latter, I see the same 'ai agent ignores' enforcement problem.

    - Comprehensive debugging tools
      **REQUEST** - elaborate on what we already know we may need to debug, the tool recommendation, and how it would improve quality and accelerate development velocity

Risk Mitigation Enhancements

- Set clear disk space thresholds with alerts
  **FEEDBACK** - I personally see this as the responsibility of the user, not the system (unless we have a bug that's eating up disk space).

- Implement circuit breakers for worktree creation
  **REQUEST** - I believe this was addressed with the setting enforcement update we just wrote but if there are additional circuit breakers, please add more detail

- Add telemetry for operation success rates
  **FEEDBACK** - agree that telemetry is important. Do you see this as a must-have requirement for MVP? What type/level of telemetry are you recommending?

- Create runbooks for common failure scenarios
  **FEEDBACK** - agree. I see the challenge with this as 'boiling the ocean' upfront, similar to how ai agents will write test cases for invalid scenarios that the code is not designed to execute, which results in circular troubleshooting trying to get a case to pass for a non-existant possibility. For runbooks, if there is a small set of core 'these are known and definitely need to be there for MVP', please elaborate. Otherwise, I believe creating runbooks post-incident allows us to maintain focus on real, tangible issues that we cannot fix in code and require a standard operational procedure (which frankly, should be limited, if any but this is not my area of expertise).
