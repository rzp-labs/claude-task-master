## CLI Command Prompts

### parse-prd

**File**: `scripts/modules/task-manager/parse-prd.js`

#### Standard Mode System Prompt

```
You are a senior software architect specialized in breaking down Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into actionable, atomic development tasks. Your expertise includes:
- Creating clear, implementable tasks from high-level requirements
- Identifying logical dependencies between tasks
- Estimating complexity and priority
- Defining acceptance criteria and test strategies

Generate exactly ${numTasks} discrete, actionable implementation tasks based on the provided PRD.

Follow these rules strictly:
1. Each task must be independently implementable (though it may depend on others)
2. Task titles should be concise action statements (e.g., "Implement user authentication")
3. Descriptions should be 1-2 sentences explaining what needs to be done
4. Details should include specific implementation guidance, technical considerations, and acceptance criteria
5. Test strategies should define how to verify the task is complete
6. Dependencies should reference other task IDs (as integers)
7. Assign priorities based on: dependencies, business value, and technical prerequisites
8. Tasks should represent 2-8 hours of work for an experienced developer
9. Include tasks for: core features, tests, documentation, deployment setup, and integration
10. Order tasks by implementation sequence

Output the tasks as a JSON object matching this exact structure:
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "string - concise action statement",
      "description": "string - 1-2 sentence explanation",
      "details": "string - implementation details, technical requirements, acceptance criteria",
      "testStrategy": "string - how to verify completion",
      "dependencies": [array of task IDs as numbers],
      "priority": "high" | "medium" | "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Standard Mode User Prompt

```
Based on the following PRD, generate exactly ${numTasks} implementation tasks:

## MCP Tool Prompts

All MCP tools use the same prompts as their CLI counterparts through shared direct functions:

- `parse_prd` → uses parse-prd.js prompts
- `expand_task` → uses expand-task.js prompts  
- `analyze_project_complexity` → uses analyze-task-complexity.js prompts
- `update_tasks` → uses update-tasks.js prompts
- `update_task` → uses update-task-by-id.js prompts
- `update_subtask` → uses update-subtask-by-id.js prompts

This ensures consistency between CLI and MCP interfaces.

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### 1. Structured Output
All prompts explicitly define the expected JSON structure to ensure consistent parsing.

### 2. Role Definition
Prompts begin with clear role definitions (e.g., "senior software architect", "Perplexity AI").

### 3. Explicit Rules
Numbered rules provide clear constraints and expectations for the AI.

### 4. Context Preservation
Update prompts emphasize preserving existing data and only modifying specified fields.

### 5. Template Variables
Dynamic content is inserted using `${variable}` syntax for flexibility.

### 6. Research Mode Variants
Separate prompts for research-enabled providers (Perplexity) with emphasis on current best practices.

## Template Variables Reference

### Common Variables
- `${numTasks}` - Number of tasks to generate
- `${task.id}` - Task identifier
- `${task.title}` - Task title
- `${task.description}` - Task description
- `${task.details}` - Implementation details
- `${task.testStrategy}` - Testing approach
- `${task.status}` - Current task status
- `${task.priority}` - Task priority level

### Command-Specific Variables
- `${prdContent}` - Product requirements document content (parse-prd)
- `${numSubtasks}` - Number of subtasks to generate (expand)
- `${promptAdditionalContext}` - Additional user-provided context (expand)
- `${fromTaskId}` - Starting task ID for updates (update)
- `${prompt}` - User instruction for updates (various update commands)

### Computed Variables
- `${JSON.stringify(tasks, null, 2)}` - Formatted task JSON
- `${tasksToUpdate}` - Filtered list of tasks to update
- `${parentTask}` - Parent task object for subtask updates

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: All prompts follow similar structure and formatting
2. **Clarity**: Explicit rules and requirements prevent ambiguity
3. **Flexibility**: Template variables allow dynamic customization
4. **Validation**: Output schemas ensure proper formatting
5. **Context**: Full task context provided for accurate updates
6. **Preservation**: Update operations explicitly preserve unchanged fields
