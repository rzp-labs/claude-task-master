## Contributing Guidelines

When contributing to these docs:

1. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the established directory hierarchy
2. **Use Relative Paths**: All links should be relative to project root
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link between related documents
4. **Keep Current**: Update when implementation changes
5. **Be Thorough**: This is where deep technical knowledge lives

## Understanding the Organization

The documentation is organized by concern:

- **Technical Implementation** → `tm-deepcode-analysis/`
- **AI Integration** → `tm-deepcode-analysis/ai-prompts-documentation/`
- **Tool Philosophy & Integration** → `claude-code-cosmotechnics/`
- **Testing Guides** → Individual markdown files

This structure allows contributors to quickly find the information they need while maintaining clear boundaries between different aspects of the system.
