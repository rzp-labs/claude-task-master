Refactor $ARGUMENTS to improve code quality and maintainability.

Analyze the code and apply appropriate refactoring techniques:

## Code Structure Improvements
- Extract methods for complex logic
- Introduce appropriate design patterns
- Improve class/module organization
- Reduce coupling between components
- Increase cohesion within modules

## Naming and Clarity
- Rename variables/functions for clarity
- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Clarify complex conditional logic
- Improve code readability

## Simplification
- Remove dead code
- Eliminate redundancy
- Simplify complex expressions
- Reduce nesting levels
- Combine similar functionality

## Modern Patterns
- Update to modern language features
- Apply functional programming concepts where appropriate
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement proper error handling patterns

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize without sacrificing readability
- Remove unnecessary computations
- Improve algorithm efficiency where possible
- Consider caching strategies

Ensure all tests pass after refactoring and maintain backward compatibility. Provide a summary of changes made and their benefits.
