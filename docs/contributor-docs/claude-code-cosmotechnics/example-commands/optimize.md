Analyze the performance of $ARGUMENTS and suggest optimizations.

Please:
1. Profile the current implementation to identify bottlenecks
2. Analyze algorithmic complexity and data structures
3. Look for inefficient patterns or redundant operations
4. Check for memory leaks or excessive allocations
5. Suggest concrete optimizations with expected improvements
6. Provide refactored code examples where applicable
7. Include benchmarking strategies to measure improvements

Focus on both micro-optimizations and architectural improvements that could yield significant performance gains.
