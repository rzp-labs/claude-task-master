# Claude Code and Task Master Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explores how Claude Code's slash command system can integrate with the Task Master task management system, creating a powerful cosmotechnical apparatus for AI-assisted project management.

## Integration Opportunities

### 1. Task Master Slash Commands

Create custom slash commands that interact with Task Master's functionality:

#### Task Management Commands

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-parse-prd.md
Parse the PRD at $ARGUMENTS using Task Master to generate implementation tasks.
Use the research mode for better technology recommendations.
Store the results in tasks.json and generate task files for the team.
```

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-next.md
Using Task Master, identify the next task to work on based on:
- Current task dependencies
- Task priorities  
- Complexity scores
Then begin working on that task, keeping me informed of progress.
```

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-expand.md
Expand task #$ARGUMENTS into subtasks using Task Master.
Analyze the task details and generate 3-5 concrete subtasks.
Update the tasks.json file and regenerate task documentation.
```

#### Status and Progress Commands

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-status.md
Show the current status of all tasks in the project.
Include:
- Tasks by status (pending, in-progress, done)
- Dependency graph visualization
- Next recommended tasks
- Overall project progress
```

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-complete.md
Mark task #$ARGUMENTS as complete in Task Master.
Then:
1. Update any dependent tasks
2. Identify the next task to work on
3. Generate a brief progress report
4. Commit the task file updates
```

### 2. MCP Integration

Claude Code can connect to Task Master's MCP server for deeper integration:

```json
// .claude/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/task-master/mcp-server/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "TASK_MASTER_PROJECT_ROOT": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This enables Claude Code to:
- Access Task Master tools directly
- Maintain task state across sessions
- Coordinate with other MCP-enabled tools

### 3. Workflow Automation

Combine Claude Code's capabilities with Task Master's structure:

#### Automated Task Workflow

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-auto-task.md
Automatically work on task #$ARGUMENTS:
1. Read the task details from Task Master
2. Analyze the codebase to understand context
3. Implement the required changes
4. Generate appropriate tests
5. Run tests to verify the implementation
6. Update task status to 'done' if successful
7. Create a commit with proper message
8. Move to the next task if time permits
```

#### Project Initialization

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-init-project.md
Initialize a new project with Task Master:
1. Parse the PRD at $ARGUMENTS
2. Generate initial task breakdown
3. Set up project structure based on tasks
4. Create initial documentation
5. Set up testing framework
6. Initialize git repository
7. Create first commit
```

### 4. Cosmotechnical Synthesis

The integration creates a unique cosmotechnical system where:

#### Ontological Fusion
- Task Master's task ontology (entities, dependencies, states)
- Claude Code's action ontology (files, commits, tests)
- Unified through slash commands as mediating devices

#### Political Harmonization
- Task Master's priority and dependency system
- Claude Code's permission and approval model
- Combined to create accountable AI assistance

#### Technical Orchestration
- Task Master's AI-powered task generation
- Claude Code's file manipulation capabilities
- Coordinated through MCP protocol

#### Systematic Integration
- Task Master's workflow management
- Claude Code's tool ecosystem
- United in coherent development process

#### Evaluative Alignment
- Task Master's complexity analysis
- Claude Code's cost tracking
- Merged for comprehensive project metrics

## Example Implementation

### Project Structure
```
project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── task-master/
│   │   │   ├── parse.md
│   │   │   ├── next.md
│   │   │   ├── expand.md
│   │   │   ├── complete.md
│   │   │   └── status.md
│   │   └── workflows/
│   │       ├── auto-implement.md
│   │       └── full-cycle.md
│   └── mcp.json
├── .taskmaster/
│   ├── config.json
│   └── tasks/
├── tasks.json
└── CLAUDE.md
```

### Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Planning**
   ```
   claude > /project:task-master:status
   claude > /project:task-master:next
   ```

2. **Task Implementation**
   ```
   claude > Implement the current task following the details in the task file
   claude > /project:test-gen src/newFeature.js
   claude > Run the tests and fix any issues
   ```

3. **Task Completion**
   ```
   claude > /project:task-master:complete 5
   claude > Create a commit for this task
   ```

4. **Progress Review**
   ```
   claude > /project:task-master:status
   claude > Generate a daily progress summary
   ```

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### 1. Context-Aware Commands

Slash commands that understand both Task Master state and code context:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-context-implement.md
Implement the current task with full context awareness:
1. Get current task from Task Master
2. Analyze related code mentioned in previous tasks
3. Review similar implementations in the codebase
4. Implement with awareness of project patterns
5. Ensure consistency with completed tasks
```

### 2. Intelligent Task Generation

Combine Claude Code's code analysis with Task Master's task generation:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-analyze-generate.md
Analyze the codebase at $ARGUMENTS and generate tasks:
1. Understand the current architecture
2. Identify technical debt and improvement opportunities
3. Generate tasks for refactoring and optimization
4. Set appropriate dependencies based on code structure
5. Create a improvement roadmap
```

### 3. Collaborative Commands

Enable team coordination through shared commands:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/tm-team-sync.md
Prepare for team sync:
1. Generate summary of completed tasks since last sync
2. Identify blockers in current tasks
3. Suggest task reassignments based on dependencies
4. Create visual progress report
5. Draft talking points for discussion
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Command Naming Conventions
- Prefix Task Master commands with `tm-` or nest under `task-master/`
- Use descriptive names that indicate the action
- Group related commands in subdirectories

### 2. State Consistency
- Always sync with Task Master before major operations
- Use Task Master as the source of truth for task state
- Commit task updates regularly

### 3. Error Handling
- Commands should gracefully handle missing tasks.json
- Provide clear feedback when Task Master operations fail
- Include recovery suggestions in error messages

### 4. Documentation
- Document custom workflows in CLAUDE.md
- Keep command descriptions clear and actionable
- Include examples in complex commands

## Conclusion

The integration of Claude Code and Task Master creates a powerful cosmotechnical system that:

1. **Preserves Human Agency**: While automating routine tasks
2. **Enables Systematic Development**: Through task-driven workflows
3. **Maintains Flexibility**: Via customizable slash commands
4. **Ensures Accountability**: Through tracked task completion
5. **Fosters Innovation**: By freeing developers for creative work

This synthesis represents a new paradigm in AI-assisted development where project management and code implementation unite in a coherent, human-centered system.
